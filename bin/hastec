# We would like to run it as the current user, like so:
#    docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -i -t -v "${PWD}:/src" $IMAGE hastec $*
# but if we do, it has trouble accessing its own files inside the container.
# So we run it as normal, and try to tolerate the fact that any files it creates
# will be owned by root.
