The Cannery
===========

[Cat's Eye Technologies][] now has [Docker images available on Docker Hub][]
for several of its distributions.

Putting a Dockerfile and a build script in each distribution repository
felt not-quite-right somehow, so this repository was created to hold all
the Dockerfiles, build scripts, and documentation for each Docker image.

It is rather experimental.  It may turn out that a different way of
organizing all this would be better.  We'll see.
